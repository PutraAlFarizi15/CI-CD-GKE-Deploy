# Using CI/CD Workflow on Google Kubernetes Engine for Text Generation Using GPT-2  

## **Overview of the Project**  
This project focuses on deploying a text generation model based on GPT-2 to **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** using an automated **CI/CD pipeline**. The GPT-2 model generates coherent text based on user prompts and is exposed as an **API endpoint**.  

The deployment ensures scalability and availability by leveraging Kubernetes and Cloud Build for automation.

- **Endpoint**: [http://34.134.197.8](http://34.134.197.8)  
- **Repository**: [CI-CD-GKE-Deploy](https://github.com/PutraAlFarizi15/CI-CD-GKE-Deploy)

## **API Access**  
To access the API, use the following endpoint: **[http://34.134.197.8](http://34.134.197.8)**.  

### Features:  
1. **Enter Your Prompt**: A text input field to enter your prompt or initial text for text generation.  
2. **Generate Text**: A button to generate coherent text based on the provided prompt.  

### How to Use:  
1. Enter your desired prompt in the **Enter Your Prompt** field.  
2. Click the **Generate Text** button to start the text generation process.  
3. The generated text will be displayed as a response from the model.
